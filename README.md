# Machine Learning Project for UK Retailer: Customer-Segmentation and Customer-Purchasing-Patterns

Thanks to an e-commerce actual data transactions from an UK retailer in this notebook we are going to explore an e-commerce dataset transactions from an UK retailer, this dataset lists purchases made by approximately 40000 customers 
through a period of time of one year (from 12/01/2010 to 12/09/2011).

The main aim of this notebook is to develop a machine learning model that allows to anticipate the purhcases that will be made by a new customer, 
over the next year according to its firsts purchases.

### The notebook was developed by performing the next steps:

* Data Cleaning.
* Feature Exploration.
* Understanding Product Categories.
* Customers Categories.
* Classifying Customers.
* Testing Predictions.
* Explaining The Decissions of The Model.
